Project Title - Phishing Domain Detection
Technologies - Machine Learning Technology
Domain - Cyber Security
Project Difficulties level - Intermediate
Problem Statement:
Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or
person in order to get sensitive information such as login credentials or account
information via email or other communication channels. Phishing is popular among
attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears
to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures.
The mail goal is to predict whether the domains are real or malicious.
Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.
For Feature Engineering show:-
1. URL-Based Features
2. Domain-Based Features
3. Page-Based Features
4. Content-Based Features
Results: You have to build a solution that should able to predict whether the domain is
real or fake.

Project Evaluation metrics :
Code:
 You are supposed to write a code in a modular fashion
 Safe: It can be used without causing harm.
 Testable: It can be tested at the code level.
 Maintainable: It can be maintained, even as your codebase grows.
 Portable: It works the same in every environment(operating system )
 You have to maintain your code on GitHub.
 You have to keep your GitHub repo public so that anyone can check your code.
 Proper readme file you have to maintain for any project development.
 You should include basic workflow and execution of the entire project in the readme
file on GitHub
 Follow the coding standards: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
Cloud:
 You can use any cloud platform for this entire solution hosting like AWS, Azure or
GCP
API Details or user interface:
 You have to expose your complete solution as an API or try to create a user
interface for your model testing. Anything will be fine for us.
Logging:
 Logging is a must for every action performed by your code use the python logging
library for this.
Ops Pipeline:
 If possible, you can try to use AI ops pipelining for project delivery Ex. DVC,
MLflow, Sagemaker , Azure machine learning studio, Jenkins, Circle CI, Azure
DevOps , Tfx, Travis CI etc.
Deployment:
 You can host your model in the cloud platform, edge devices, or maybe local, but
with a proper justification of your system design.
Solutions Design:
 You have to submit complete solution design strategies in HLD and LLD document
System Architecture:
 You have to submit a system architecture design in your wireframe document and
architecture document.
Latency for model response:
 You have to measure the response time of your model for a particular input of a
dataset.
Optimization of solutions:
 Try to optimize your solution on code level, architecture level and mention all of
these things in your final submission.
 Mention your test cases for your project
